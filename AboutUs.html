We're dedicated to giving you the very best computer services and electronic gadgets, with a focus on dependability, best customer service, effectiveness and uniqueness.
        Founded in 2018 by Mr. Tatenda Muchapararwa, Tattz Industries has come a long way from its beginnings in a lecture room at the Harare Institute Of Technology in Harare, Zimbabwe. When Mr. Muchapararwa first started out, his passion for the betterment of his country and to put Zimbabwe on the global map for technology drove him to have sleepless nights trying to figure out ways to build a company that would offer computer services to the locals and to the world at large, and this gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming software company. We now serve customers all over the world, and are thrilled to be a part of the good cause of providing technologyservices to people.
       
        We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
